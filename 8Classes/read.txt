Class : 
The planning i define of my object is called classes , bascially blueprint of my upcoming object code
Class contains static things like -> age = 19 , weight = 70
Class contains behaviour like -> walking() , range() contains functions which i can call later
ex : class human{
age = 19;
#height = 5;
};
now private -> to mark private we use "#"
to use private , but pvt used only in class -> to use pvt i use "this (->)" -> this.#height

Object : 
Object is created using classes 
like : 
Human a = new Human()    -> object a created
a.age                    -> now i can age from class Human
a.height


To use pvt member outside the class is we use : getter and setter
we use getter setter to make clearity in my code and add ENCAPSULATION and do DATA PROTECTION

Constructor : 
When i want to initialise my data my members inside the class , there i use Constructor to initialise outside the class
To use contructor , i pass values while declaring contructor

Default Parameter : 
allow to use function with default values
