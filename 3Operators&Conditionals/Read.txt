Loops : for , while , do-while
for -> for in , for each, 

for : 
for(initialisation ; condition; updation){
    body
}
ex-> 
for(int i = 1 ; i<=10 ; i++){
    console.log("hello naman")
}

break : whenever break , stop that iteration and exit the loop
continue : dont break just skip that and continue with other part

while:
initialisation;
while(condition){
    body
    updation;
}

do while:
initialisation
do{
//
//
//logic
//updation
}while(condition)
Will not use do while frequently coz it prints the first statement anyhow without checking any condititon


Strings : 
sequeance of characters
ex=> "naman" , "n" , ""
operations -> concat , substring, length, uppercase, lowercase, find char , find location

substrings : 
console.log(str1.substring(index));

Using \\ :
using this says that char forward to me dont treat that as special char , treat it as normal char
to print it normal , we use when we want to print signs normally in Strings
