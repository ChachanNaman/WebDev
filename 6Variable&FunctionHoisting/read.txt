Hoisting : Shift the process such as Variable Declaration & function Declaration to the top in their scope
In var Declaration -> only variable initialised shift upwards but not its value, means if i call print var before declation it will not show any value
in func Declaration -> whole function shift upward , means if i call function before defining , it will give result

Defining class with all thing included in it and at the instance its called Object
Soo blueprint is class and at instance is called object

Function call stack : 
stores thing in LIFO

Function : is first class citizen coz 
i can assign variables
i can pass another function too as an argument in one function
i can return function 
i can create DS of Functions
i can use property as function
